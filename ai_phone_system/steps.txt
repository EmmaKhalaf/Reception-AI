🌟 THE END PRODUCT (How your platform will work for business owners)
A business owner visits your website and:

1. Creates an account
They sign up like any normal SaaS platform.

2. Enters their business details
They fill out:

Business name

Services

Open hours

Location

Staff (optional)

3. Connects their calendar
They can:

Connect Google Calendar

Connect Outlook

Or use your built‑in calendar

Your system stores their availability and business hours.

4. Enters their phone number
They choose:

Use a Twilio number you provide

OR forward their existing number to your Twilio number

OR port their number into Twilio

5. Your system automatically creates an AI phone assistant
Behind the scenes, your backend will:

Create a Twilio AI assistant for that business

Attach the assistant to their phone number

Set up the webhook to your backend

Sync their calendar

Apply their business hours

Customize the AI’s personality and responses

Enable call answering + SMS automation

All automatically.

6. The business owner logs into your website to see everything
They get a dashboard where they can see:

Their calendar

Booked appointments

Missed calls

AI call transcripts

SMS conversations

Customer details

Business hours

Settings

This is exactly how modern AI phone systems work.

📞 What happens when a customer calls their number?
Your AI will:

Answer the call

Greet the caller using the business name

Check the business hours

Check the calendar availability

Offer appointment times

Book the appointment

Send confirmation SMS

Log everything in the business owner’s dashboard

All fully automated.

🧠 YES — The calendar is unique for each business
Each business owner has:

Their own calendar

Their own open hours

Their own AI assistant

Their own phone number

Their own dashboard

Your backend simply uses their account ID to know which calendar to check.

🚀 You are building a multi‑tenant AI phone system
This is the same model used by:

GoHighLevel

Numa

Except you’re building your own version.
